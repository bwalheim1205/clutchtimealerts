# ClutchTimeBot - NBA Clutch Time Alert Bot
A bot that tracks ongoing NBA games and sends alerts when games enter "clutch time"â€”the last five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime when the point difference is five points or fewer. The bot monitors live game data and sends notifications via configured messaging platforms (such as Discord, Slack, or SMS) to keep you informed of the most intense moments.

## Features
- **Real-Time Clutch Detection**: Monitors live NBA game data and detects when games enter clutch time.
- **Customizable Alerts**: Configure the bot to send alerts on various platforms (Discord, Slack, SMS, etc.).
